This post is my first post on my blog.  I would like to mention how excited I
am to be researching Matplotlib Serialization with the developers of Matplotlib.
The following links are some first readings, one including the enhancement
in which I used to create my proposal:

    * [MEP25][http://matplotlib.org/devel/MEP/MEP25.html]
    * [Mpld3 Quick Start][https://mpld3.github.io/quickstart.html]
    * [Matplotlib Figure Serialization][http://matplotlib.1069221.n5.nabble.com/matplotlib-figure-serialization-td18587.html]
    * [Pickle][https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html]
    * [Python Class JSON Serialization][http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3768895/how-to-make-a-class-json-serializable]
    * [Serialization of a Python Object to JSON][http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10252010/serializing-python-object-instance-to-json]

When I get in contact with mentors directly, I'm sure that I will have more of
an understanding with what I will be working with.  Nonetheless, I am ecstatic
to be working on an enhancement that will progress the usability of Matplotlib.
