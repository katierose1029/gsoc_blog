Since last posting here, I have asked the community on Gitter where I should start researching before the coding period begins.
I was given a small check list of two things to complete:
1. Install a developers version of matplotlib and traitlets
2. Become familiar with traitlets

In doing this, I created a repo called gsoc_work which will be used for my own testing
and exploring purposes.

Also I looked up  articles to assist me and here are two I have yet to read:
1. http://carreau.github.io/posts/09-Matplotlib-And-IPython-Config.html
2. https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/8035
