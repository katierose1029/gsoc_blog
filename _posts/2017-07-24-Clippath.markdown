Tasks for 7/24/17:
1. Clippath Traits

Note: Mentor said *Clippath* should be a *Union* Trait but I am going to disagree.
Reason being that *Clippath* is not a union of instances.
*Clippath* can take in either a *matplotlib.patches.Patch* or *matplotlib.path.Path*
If the input value for transform is *True* when setting the value of *Clippath*
the logic determine the value is different.

Note Revised: I think this is a *Union*. This needs the TransformTrait in order
to handle the *None* logic.
