In this meeting, our Professor approved of the reasoning why the project is valuable
Reasons mentioned were:
1. Reproducibility value of the image
    * Have the ability to serialize an image and then be able to load back into the program.
    * This would help save a state of a graph; especially when the kernel dies and possible imagery is lost.
2. Make figure interoperable
    * We should have the ability to have a text representation of an image and alter the data if it is necessary. (This goal cannot be achieved if just saved as an image)
    * Be able to treat a graph as data itself as opposed to a static image.
3. Rendering to the web
    * Matplotlib is a Python library; serialization would allow graphs to be rendered out to the web (i.e. Javascript) much easier; especially since we would be able to use different rendering backends (i.e. Node.js, React.js, etc.).
