Tasks for 6/8/17:
1. fix my jupyter notebook
2. go through examples and create my own [My Traitlet Examples][myex]

Note: Minor set back because my jupyter notebook kernel hasn't been working correctly

Next Task:
1. making a Transform trait
    * this will be the first of other traits implemented in `Artist`
    * `Artist` mainly contains set and get methods; by creating traits, in theory we will
    not need them anymore

Note to self: Think about the `Artist Inspector` & whether we have consider altering it or not
