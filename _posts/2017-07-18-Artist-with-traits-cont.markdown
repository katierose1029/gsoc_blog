Tasks for 7/17/17:
1. Continue Artist with Traits
    * determine which functions can be brought over from original artist class.
        * ie: we will not need the get and set methods due to the migration to traitlets, however we may need some of the auxiliary functions for drawing/rendering purposes 
2. Configure development branch origin/artist-dev with upstream/traitlets branch
    * fix pull request to upstream/traitlets
3. Discuss with mentor on how to go about testing
