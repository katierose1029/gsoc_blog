Tasks for 7/06/17:
1. Continue implementing Artist using traitlets
2. Understand Github project management better

Note: There are some attributes in Artist that do not need their own
trait implemented separately. These attributes can be represented using an
Instance trait

Note: We are taking a step back in order to understand the workflow of github
branches so that instead of making one big pull request, we will be making small
incremental ones in order to succeed
