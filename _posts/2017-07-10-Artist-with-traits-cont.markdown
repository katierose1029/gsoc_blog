Tasks for 7/10/17:
1. Fix Artist workings
2. Implement validate & observe functions for the traits I am certain of
3. Discuss further ideas/actions towards attributes in which I am not certain of

1. axisImage
    axes do before figure
2. *figure*
4. text
5. lines
3. transforms
    * major interactions with jupyter

does stale and pchanged order matter ?
    * not sure if thought out design
    * marking things as stale will trigger a redraw
    * do i actually need to redraw? is the question to be asked
backward compatability
    * wrapper callback get dictionary of what happened
    * decprecating callbacks will be good move towards understanding/maintaining callbacks
* top level of the mpl package
