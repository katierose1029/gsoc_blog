Now that the Coding Period of GSOC has began, I am just finishing my final
exams and beginning to focus on the task at hand.  I know that I have some
catch up to do, but during this first official week, I am focusing on the
Anatomy of Matplotlib and Ipywidgets/traitlets module.  My mentor had made
a contribution to Ipywidgets he thinks will be of use later on the in the
program.

That being said, I just wanted to check in and wish everyone in the program
good luck in the task he/she is completing!
